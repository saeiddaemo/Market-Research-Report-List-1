<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Period Cramp Pain Killer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NSAID</li><li>Acetaminophen</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The period cramp pain killer market primarily comprises two types: NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) and Acetaminophen. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, work by reducing inflammation and alleviating pain, making them effective for menstrual cramps.

Both types are widely used, with NSAIDs generally preferred for more severe discomfort due to their additional anti-inflammatory properties, while acetaminophen is often chosen for mild to moderate pain relief.</p></p>
