<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carotid Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expandable Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carotid stents market consists primarily of two types: balloon-expandable stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon-expandable stents are positioned in the carotid artery and expanded using a balloon, offering a precise fit, typically used in higher blood flow areas. Self-expanding stents, on the other hand, utilize a material that expands upon deployment, adapting to the vesselâ€™s contours, providing flexibility. Both types aim to restore blood flow, reduce stroke risk, and enhance patient outcomes in carotid artery diseases.</p></p>
