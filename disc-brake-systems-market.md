<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disc Brake Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston Type</li><li>Floating Caliper Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disc brake systems market is primarily categorized into two types: piston type and floating caliper type. Piston type disc brakes utilize fixed calipers with pistons that apply pressure directly to the brake pads, offering consistent braking performance and improved heat dissipation. In contrast, floating caliper type brakes feature a moveable caliper that shifts to evenly distribute pressure on both sides of the disc, allowing for a compact design and efficient braking. Both types are essential for automotive safety and performance.</p></p>
